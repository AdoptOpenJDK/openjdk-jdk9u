/* Note: It would be nice to verify the minimal supported heap size (2m) here,
 * but we align the heap size based on the card table size. And the card table
 * size is aligned based on the minimal pages size provided by the os. This
 * means that on most platforms, where the minimal page size is 4k, we get a
 * minimal heap size of 2m but on Solaris/Sparc we have a page size of 8k and
 * get a minimal heap size of 4m. And on platforms where the page size is 64k
 * we get a minimal heap size of 32m. We never use large pages for the card table.
 *
 * There is also no check in the VM for verifying that the maximum heap size
 * is larger than the supported minimal heap size. This means that specifying
 * -Xmx1m on the command line is fine but will give a heap of 2m (or 4m or 32m).
 *
 * To work around these rather strange behaviors this test uses -Xmx2m but then
 * calculates what the expected heap size should be. The calculation is a
 * simplified version of the code in the VM. We assume that the card table will
 * use one page. Each byte in the card table corresponds to 512 bytes on the heap.
 * So, the expected heap size is page_size * 512.
